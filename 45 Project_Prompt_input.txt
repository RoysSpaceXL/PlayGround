i want some relationships in this main graph to mirror/export/ transform in other MD document in other type of graph for further detailing and still maintaning the relationship with this maingraph. 
for example i want to higlight the partlyflow of "dreams" to "creation" in another graph like flowchart and elaborate on it. if something fundamental changes in the flowcharts, i should be able to backtrack to this main graph and vice versa. please give some advice.
//
is this approach of classdiagram transforming to flow chart the right decision for further project-detailing? the end target is to get an mermaid overview graph of the src files; mermaid.html , mermaid.js and the readme.md of this project folder.
could i use other graph formats of mermaid?

'mermaid.html' --> 'mermaid.js'
    'mermaid.js' --> 'style.css'
    'mermaid.html' --> 'README.md'
    note for 'mermaid.js' Handles rendering logic and DOM events
    end

i want to expand ##3.1 flowchart with more details on module/component level and the interaction between the html and js files.  to create in new chapter ## 3.2 as type 4 as new tryout.

    //
    the basic for my request is the "45readme.md" file, "45 vision bubbles from chaos to order.md",# 4.5  is the layout template example.could you compile/tranform the info from the "45readme.md"; ## 4 and separate ### 4.4,as an classdiagram,  and fill in as # 4.6 and as # 4.7?  starting from line 107?
